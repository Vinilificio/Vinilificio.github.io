# Mastering audio, ottimizzazione per vinile, restauro

Each sound recording – whether vinyl, files, CDs, DVDs, or video – has its own technical characteristics (advantages and limitations). Mastering can adjust the audio for the support on which it will be transferred. Mastering is an essential process for making a high quality sound product (without errors) and especially for emphasizing those “colors” and  “tones” that otherwise remain imperceptible.
