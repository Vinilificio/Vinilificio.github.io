### Audio

#### How much music can you record on vinyl?

On vinyl the amount of music engraved on each side determines the volume of the recorded signal.

The groove of the vinyl record takes up more space when engraved at high volume, while it takes up less space when etched at low volume.

(-) each side = (+) volume

(+) each side = (-) volume


The best quality-quantity proportion is:

* 12″ to 33 rpm ​​at high volume max. 12 min.
* 12″ to 45 rpm at high volume max. 9 min.
* 10″ to 33 rpm ​​at high volume max. 8 min.
* 10″ to 45 rpm at high volume max. 6 min.
* 7″ to 45 rpm at high volume max. 4 min.


Quality-quantity proportion for 12″ 33 rpm:

* over 12 min. each side   ->     high volume
* 12 / 15 min. each side   ->     middle  high volume
* 15 / 20 min. each side   ->     middle  low volume
* less then 20 min. each side  (max. 25 minutes)      ->     low volume

*Standard formats*

#### Audio files and some important advice
You can record on vinyl more or less any type of audio signal. To have a good quality, however, it is suggested to follow some important indications.

Remember that the quality of the audio master will be better, the better the quality of the vinyl engraving will be.

We can transfer on vinyl any audio file i.e. wav, aiff, flac, mp3...

**Low freqeunces:**

* Frequencies below 20 Hz can create resonance problems.
* In order to avoid out of phase with consequent interruptions of the groove and therefore the jump of the needle, it is advisable to keep MONO frequencies below 300 hz.
* Avoid out of phase if you do not have a thorough mastering knowledge. To check if there are any out of phase use a "correlation meter" present almost all audio programs.

**High frequences:**

* De-esser: It is recommended to use a de-esser on the voices and in general on the sibilants
* It is not possible to record frequencies above 14/15 Khz at very high volumes
* For a better risultato we recommend placing the tracks with higher frequencies at the beginning of the vinyl.
